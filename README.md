# (WIP) Yoga-rl ðŸ§˜

Yoga-rl is a set of standardized environments to interface with RL Agents.

Yoga-rl is heavily inspired by the OpenAI's Gym and Retro library and provides a similar interface and API. This means users familiar with these APIs can easily use Yoga-rl

## Setup:

**Install all dependencies**
```
npm install
```

**Build the project**
```
npm run build
```

**Run all the tests**
```
npm test
```
