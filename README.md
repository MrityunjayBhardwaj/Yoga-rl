# (WIP) Yoga.js ðŸ§˜

Yoga.js is a set of headless standardized environments to interface with RL Agents.

Yoga.js is heavily inspired by the OpenAI's Gym and Retro library and provides a similar interface and API. This means users familiar with these APIs can easily use Yoga.js

## Setup:

**Install all dependencies**
```
npm install
```

**Build the project**
```
npm run build
```

**Run all the tests**
```
npm test
```
